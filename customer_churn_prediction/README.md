# Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts whether a customer will churn (leave the company) using machine learning classification techniques.

## Problem Type
Binary Classification

## Dataset
Customer churn dataset containing demographic and service-related features.

## Steps Performed
- Data Cleaning
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature Scaling
- Train-test split
- Model training using Random Forest
- Model evaluation using confusion matrix and accuracy

## Model Used
Random Forest Classifier

## Results
- Accuracy: ~78%
- Confusion Matrix:

[[928 107]
 [197 178]]

Focus was given on minimizing false negatives as churn prediction is a business-critical problem.

## Libraries Used
- pandas
- scikit-learn
